# applied-data-science-capstone-spacex
The commercial space industry is rapidly evolving, with SpaceX emerging as a leader due to its relatively inexpensive rocket launches. A key factor contributing to SpaceX's cost-efficiency is the reuse of the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage, which allows them to offer launch services for $62 millionâ€”far below the $165 million typical of other providers. The ability to predict whether the first stage will land successfully is critical in determining overall launch costs.

This project aims to address that challenge by developing a machine learning model to <b>estimate launch prices for a new competitor</b>, Space Y, which seeks to enter the market and compete with SpaceX. Using public data on SpaceX's launches, <b>the model will predict the likelihood of first-stage reuse</b>, providing key insights into pricing strategies for Space Y.
